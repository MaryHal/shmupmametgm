* shmupmametgm
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
This is a modified version of MAME with modifications in Psikyo SH-2 emulation (tgm2, tgm2p) that eliminate one extra frame of lag compared to vanilla MAME.
#+END_QUOTE

This version correctly configures MAME to use 4-way stick emulation for tgm2p and also backports a framerate fix so tgm2p should run at the correct ~61.681 fps.

This version of shmupmametgm has been modified so that it can output piece placement data to a text file when a game of tgm2p is completed. You can then paste the file's contents [[http://rawgit.com/sanford1/shmupmametgm/fumen/fumen_encode.html][here]] (fumen_encode.html) to generate a fumen diagram of the game. To enable this functionality, you must either run shmupmametgm with the =-fumen= switch, or specify =fumen   1= in your =mame.ini= file. Note that this will also enable the cheat subsystem.
